For example, the social history section only mentions the patient’s current marital status and smoking habits but does not cover other important factors such as occupation, leisure activities, and family support.\n",
      "3. Conflicting information: There are some conflicting statements in the report. For instance, the patient claims that he has difficulty climbing stairs but later states that he can walk up to eight blocks without resting. This could indicate a discrepancy in the patient’s reported symptoms.\n",

      "4. Proofread: Reports should be proofread carefully to eliminate spelling and grammar errors, ensuring professionalism and accuracy.\n",

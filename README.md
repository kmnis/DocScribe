# DocScribe: Medical QA Chatbot

## Introduction
DocScribe is a medical question-and-answer chatbot that revolutionizes how we interact with medical data. DocScribe provides quick, accurate responses to both general medical inquiries and patient-specific questions. Our main goal is to enhance medical report accessibility and comprehension. DocScribe achieves this through:

- Transcription of medical reports into a more accessible format.
- Providing answers to general medical questions.
- Summarizing reports from multiple visits.
- Identifying relevant information from patient history.

## Architecture
DocScribe's architecture facilitates a seamless interaction between users and medical data. It incorporates:
- A Jupyter Notebook-based Web UI for uploading reports and further interaction.
- The creation of embeddings and indexes from medical transcripts.
- The utilization of LangChain and HuggingFace frameworks for processing and answering questions.

## Data Sources
Our project leverages a diverse range of data sources to train our model, including:
- Medical Transcripts: We leveraged the GPT-3.5 model to generate 4.5k QA prompts from the medical transcripts. [MTSamples](https://mtsamples.com/)
- WikiDoc: [Visit WikiDoc](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_wikidoc)
- WikiPatient: [Visit WikiPatient](https://huggingface.co/datasets/medalpaca/medical_meadow_wikidoc_patient_information)

### Sample Data

| Dataset     | Instruction                                       | Input                                                                                      | Output                                                                                                                                                           |

| WikiPatient | Answer this question truthfully                   | When to seek urgent medical care when I have Alstrom syndrome?                            | Call your healthcare provider if you or your child have symptoms of diabetes such as increased thirst and urination. Seek medical attention promptly if you think that your child cannot see or hear normally.          |
| MT Samples  | Based on the given medical transcript generate prompt and answer to train LLM | What was the patient's preoperative diagnosis?                                            | The patient's preoperative diagnosis was prostate cancer.                                                                                                         |


## Modeling Approach
We opted for the Vicuna-13B model, fine-tuned with LoRA, PEFT, and bitsandbytes. Our approach was validated through rigorous testing and has shown promising results in interpreting medical data.
